# Dynamic-response-to-a-monetary-without-liquidity-effect-shock
The code depicts the responses of inflation, output, real and nominal interest-rate given a simple New Keynesian model with sticky prices and an exogenous growth rate of money supply setting as a monetary policy shock, base on Galí, Jordi (2003). 

First, a typical monetary shock has strong, and highly persistent, e¤ects on output. On
impact, a one percent increase in the money supply raises output by slightly more than 1
percent, while the implied increase in the price level is of about 2.4 percent (annualized).
In addition, these e¤ects of money are quite persistent. That property is apparent in the
impulse response of output displayed in the gure 3. In particular, the half life of that output
response under the baseline calibration is 3.2 quarters.2
Second, a monetary expansion is predicted to raise the nominal rate; in other words, the
calibrated model does not predict the existence of a liquidity e¤ect. Still, that feature does
not prevent monetary policy from transmitting its e¤ects through an interest rate channel:
as shown in the same gure, the real rate declines substantially when the monetary expansion
is initiated, remaining below its steady state level for a protracted period. This persistent
decline induces the observed expansion in aggregate demand and output.
